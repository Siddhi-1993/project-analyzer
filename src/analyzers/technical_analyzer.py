        You are analyzing technical requirements for Cymbiotika, an ecommerce healthcare supplement company with mostly junior developers and one senior developer. Focus on realistic technical solutions for their team capabilities.

        Project to Analyze:
        Project Name: {project_name}
        Description: {description}

        Analyze technical feasibility considering:

        1. **Team Capability Assessment**
           - Complexity rating: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
           - Is this suitable for mostly junior developers with one senior lead?
           - Required skill level vs. current team capabilities
           - Knowledge gaps that need to be filled
           - External consultant/contractor needs

        2. **Ecommerce Platform Considerations**
           - Integration with existing Cymbiotika systems
           - Shopify Plus, custom ecommerce, or headless commerce needs
           - Subscription billing integration (ReCharge, Bold, etc.)
           - Inventory management for supplement products
           - Customer portal and account management

        3. **Healthcare/Supplement Specific Requirements**
           - Age verification systems (if needed)
           - Ingredient and allergen information displays
           - Dosage calculators or recommendation engines
           - Third-party testing result integration
           - Compliance tracking and reporting tools

        4. **Development Complexity & Timeline**
           - Junior-friendly technology choices
           - Estimated development time with current team
           - Phased development approach (MVP vs. full features)
           - Areas requiring senior developer oversight
           - Potential technical debt considerations

        5. **Infrastructure & Scalability**
           - Hosting requirements for supplement ecommerce
           - CDN needs for product images and videos
           - Database scalability for customer/order data
           - Security requirements for health products
           - Performance optimization needs

        6. **Third-Party Integrations**
           - Payment processing for supplements
           - Shipping integrations (FedEx, UPS, international)
           - Email marketing automation
           - Customer service platforms
           - Analytics and conversion tracking

        7. **Maintenance & Support Considerations**
           - Ongoing maintenance complexity
           - Documentation needs for junior developers
           - Testing and QA requirements
           - Security updates and monitoring

        **NOTE**: Keep recommendations practical for a team with limited senior technical expertise. Suggest proven, stable technologies over cutting-edge solutions. Focus on maintainable, well-documented approaches.

        Provide specific technology recommendations and realistic timelines based on the team's experience level.
